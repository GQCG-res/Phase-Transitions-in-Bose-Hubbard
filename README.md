# Summary

The Bose-Hubbard model is a theoretical model used for phenomenological descriptions of solid-state-physics and ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Its dynamics are able to uncover numerous phase transitions, most notably the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition from the Mott-insulator phase to the superfluid phase. In this study, we propose to model this phase transition using both exact diagonalization as well as matrix product state ansatzes. By examining the properties of the different phases we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the complex behavior of these systems as well as their potential applications in several areas of physics. Our results will characterize the responses of these phases to external stresses and further uncover the underlying physics of such model systems.
