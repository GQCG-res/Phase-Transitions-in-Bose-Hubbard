# Attending a poster presentation

Your poster should draw the attention of the people passing by. The following tips and tricks will help you create an enticing poster.

## Use color

Emphasizing important words and sentences in color is a surefire way to draw the attention to the key aspects of your research. Walk a mile in the shoes of your audience and think about what you would do. Would you check out the poster where you have to look for what it's about, like a needle in a haystack? Or would you check out the poster that screams "**Hey, are you interested in this problem?**". 

## Showcase your most important results

A poster only has a limited amount of space. It thus becomes imperative to choose the most important results of your entire research project to showcase. More often than not, a poster will only contain several figures. Make sure to make them count.

## Keep theory simple and straight forward

Nobody is interested in a poster they don't understand. By keeping your theory as simple as possible, people will be more encouraged to take a look at your poster and engage in discussion about your research. Not everything has to be explained in detail on the poster. You are there to do so, when people ask. 

## Introduction and conclusion should be concise

Even more so than a presentation, a poster is about *showing off* your results. You want as much space s possible for graphs and figures showing **what** you have done. Therefore, your introduction should only briefly introduce the **why**, while your conclusions should briefly support what you showed in your results. Keep in mind that, under normal circumstances, you will be standing next to your poster to elucidate any questions that you might have left on the table.
