# Outreach: promoting your research

After your research project is done, the next step is to promote your research to the rest of the community. This outreach can help you make connections with other people interested in your research and can lead to other interesting viewpoints. There are two main ways of promoting your research: giving a talk/lecture about your research and attending a poster presentation. 

## Giving  lecture about your research

When giving a lecture about your work, you will most likely need a visual aid, in order to best present your results to your audience. This is where a presentation comes into play. The documentation for creating a good, enticing presentation can be found [here](Presentation/README.md). A template is also included in order to adhere to the style of GQCG.

## Attending a poster presentation

When attending a poster presentation, you want to draw as much attention towards your research as possible. Your poster has to stick out amongst several others. The documentation for creating a poster can be found [here](Poster/README.md). A template in the style of GQCG is also provided.

## Technical details

- The *promoPack* directory contains a **.devcontainer** for all your latex compilation needs. 
- A **build.yml** file is included in the *.github* directory, which automatically builds your presentation/poster when anything is adjusted in the promo pack files.
