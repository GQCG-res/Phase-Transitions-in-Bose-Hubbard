# Presenting your research

The presentation for your research project will generally look different than what is mostly seen in an educational context. The goal of your presentation is not to *educate* your audience, but to *show off* your research.

In today's climate, where a lot of presenting happens online, it becomes that much more difficult to keep the attention of your audience. Think of most online presentations as an airplane: You remember the start and the ending, but the middle is kind of a blur. The following tips and tricks will help you avoid that.

## Avoid summaries, table of contents,... in the beginning of your presentation

As mentioned, people are much more easily distracted in an online presentation. They won't remember the table of contents anyway, so why mention it? Instead, keep your presentation enticing!

- Start with a problem that is either very prominent or even well known: this engages your audience: *Hey, I too have this problem* is the reaction you are aiming for.
- Use this problem to illustrate **why** your research is necessary: If your audience relates to the problem, they will relate to your research.

## Keep your theory section short

This, of course, depends on the audience for which you are presenting. But, as a general rule of thumb, it is good practice to limit your theory to the absolutely necessary. If your audience wants to *completely* understand all of the theoretical concepts used, they can always read your paper. The main point here is to as clearly as possible elucidate **what** you are going to do.

## Let your results speak for themselves

**Avoid text!** Your results are the main body of your presentation. This is what you want your audience to remember. And every second they spend reading the text on your presentation, is a second they are not listening to you. 

- Show your graph and explain it yourself, don't add a text explaining it.
- Use your slide titles and subtitles! If you want to say something about your figure in your slide? That's what titles are for!
- Use arrows, boxes, circles,.... Anything that can draw attention to something specific in your graph while you are talking about it, will keep your audience engaged.

> Note that, if your graphs are too complex, a pointer might be a necessity. Some programs have this feature build in. If you are using preview on a mac device [screen pointer](https://kyome.io/screen_pointer/index.html?lang=en) is a good app for this.

## Visualize your conclusions

Instead of writing down your conclusions, once again show the most important graphs of your presentation, with one line of text highlighting **what** this graph shows and **why** it is important. A visualization is much more powerful than any text.

- Keep your conclusions as your final slide! Don't add any questions, acknowledgements,... at the end. If you end on your conclusion slide, your audience will keep your key graphs and insights in mind when asking questions.

## Some general tips and tricks when presenting (online)

- Always check your tech! Nothing is more annoying than a 10 minute delay due to technical issues
- Keep your timing in mind, especially when this is strict (thesis defense, conference,...). As a general rule of thumb, one minute per slide is a good reference. 
- Keep your slides simple and straight forward.
- Look at your audience. Even online, this provides a stronger form of engagement.
- Be spontaneous. Don't study a text. 
- The UGent website's page on online lecturing has some good [general advice](https://onderwijstips.ugent.be/en/tips/online-hoorcollege-tips-voor-een-interactieve-les/) that can be applied to an online presentation as well.
